```
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-common" % "@VERSION@"  // the core library
// â€¦ optionally, other modules analog
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-fs" % "@VERSION@"  // implementation based on FS2 `Files` api
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-jdbc" % "@VERSION@"  // implementation based on JDBC
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-pglo" % "@VERSION@"  // implementation based on PostgreSQLs LargeObject API
