# Binny

Binny is a Scala library for efficiently storing and retrieving
(large) binary data from different storage systems, providing a
unified, [FS2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2)
based api.

It supports SQL databases via JDBC, PostgreSQLs large objects, S3
compatible object storage and the filesystem.

Binny is provided for Scala 2.13 and 3.

## Usage

With [sbt](https://scala-sbt.org), add the dependencies:

```
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-core" % "@VERSION@"  // the core library
// â€¦ choose one or more implementation modules
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-fs" % "@VERSION@"  // implementation based on FS2 `Files` api
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-jdbc" % "@VERSION@"  // implementation based on JDBC
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-pglo" % "@VERSION@"  // implementation based on PostgreSQLs LargeObject API
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-minio" % "@VERSION@"  // implementation for MinIO
"com.github.eikek" %% "binny-tika-detect" % "@VERSION@"  // Content-Type detection with Apache Tika
